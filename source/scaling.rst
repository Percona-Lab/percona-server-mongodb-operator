Scale Percona Server for MongoDB on Kubernetes and OpenShift
============================================================

One of the great advantages brought by Kubernetes and the OpenShift
platform is the ease of an application scaling. Scaling a Deployment up
or down ensures new Pods are created and set to available Kubernetes
nodes.

The size of the cluster is controlled by the ``size`` key in the
:ref:`operator.custom-resource-options` configuration.

.. note:: The Operator will not allow to scale Percona Server for MongoDB with
   the ``kubectl scale statefulset <StatefulSet name>`` command as it puts
   ``size`` configuration options out of sync.

You can change size separately for different components of your cluster by
setting this option in the appropriate subsections:

* :ref:`replsets.size<replsets-size>` allows to set the size of the MongoDB
  Replica Set,
* :ref:`replsets.arbiter.size<replsets-arbiter-size>` allows to set the number
  of :ref:`Replica Set Arbiter instances<arbiter>`,
* :ref:`sharding.configsvrReplSet.size<sharding-configsvrreplset-size>` allows
  to set the number of `Config Server instances <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-config-servers/>`_,
* :ref:`sharding.mongos.size<sharding-mongos-size>` allows to set the number of `mongos <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/sharded-cluster-query-router/>`_ instances.

For example, the following update in ``deploy/cr.yaml`` will set the size of the
MongoDB Replica Set to ``5`` nodes:

.. code:: yaml

   ....
   replsets:
     ....
     size: 5
     ....

Don't forget to apply changes as usual, running the
``kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml`` command.
