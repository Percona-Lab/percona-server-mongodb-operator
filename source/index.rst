Percona Kubernetes Operator for MongoDB
==========================================

The `Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator>`_ automates the creation, modification, or deletion of items in your Percona Server for MongoDB environment. The Operator contains the necessary Kubernetes settings to maintain a consistent Percona Server for MongoDB instance.

The Percona Kubernetes Operators are based on best practices for the configuration of a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set. The Operator provides many benefits but saving time, a consistent environment are the most important.

*The operator was developed and tested for the following configurations only:*

  * Percona Server for MongoDB 3.6 and Percona Server for MongoDB 4.0
  * OpenShift 3.11 and OpenShift 4.0

Other options may or may not work.

Backups are not yet supported with Percona Server for MongoDB 4.0. Backups are supported for Percona Server for MongoDB 3.6.

Also, the current PSMDB on Kubernetes implementation does not support Percona Server for MongoDB sharding.
