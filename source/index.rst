Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB
==========================================================

The `Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator>`_ automates the creation, modification, or deletion of items in your Percona Server for MongoDB environment. The Operator contains the necessary Kubernetes settings to maintain a consistent Percona Server for MongoDB instance.

The Percona Kubernetes Operators are based on best practices for the configuration of a Percona Server for MongoDB replica set. The Operator provides many benefits but saving time, a consistent environment are the most important.
